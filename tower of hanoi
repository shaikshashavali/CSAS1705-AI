% Define Towers of Hanoi predicate
hanoi(1, Source, Target, _, Moves) :-
    format('Move disk 1 from ~w to ~w~n', [Source, Target]),
    Moves = 1.
hanoi(N, Source, Target, Auxiliary, Moves) :-
    N > 1,
    N1 is N - 1,
    hanoi(N1, Source, Auxiliary, Target, Moves1),
    format('Move disk ~w from ~w to ~w~n', [N, Source, Target]),
    hanoi(N1, Auxiliary, Target, Source, Moves2),
    Moves is Moves1 + Moves2 + 1.

% Example usage:
% To solve Towers of Hanoi for 3 disks from source 'A' to target 'C' using auxiliary 'B':
% ?- hanoi(3, 'A', 'C', 'B', Moves).
